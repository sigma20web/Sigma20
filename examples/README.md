Notes:
- Evidence offsets are real Unicode code-point offsets into `manuscripts/ch09.accepted.txt`; the validator
  checks length, slice equality, NFC, paragraph id and `quote_hash`. Evidence into chapters whose text does not
  exist yet (ch.12 anchors to future chapters) is limited to ch.9 spans for that reason.
- `knowledge-ledger.json` uses short names (`Do-yoon`, `P1`) and `"chapter.ordinal"` clocks for readability;
  the DB representation uses the ids in `ids.json` and full `storyClock` objects.
- Korean appears in `narrative-profiles/` only as **source terms** in terminology policies (e.g., 헌터 →
  *hunter*); manuscript and working text are English.
- Thresholds in the profiles are **starting values** with `calibration.status = uncalibrated` (ADR-0029).
